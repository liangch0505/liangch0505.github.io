# Force Sensing Mouse and its Applications
Chen Liang, Suresh Gandhi
## Abstract
Many human-computer interaction techniques - such as mouse and user interfaces - are designed in 2D space. While this could be an easy and intuitive way to interact, a drawback of this design idea is the increasing difficulty of interacting as more and more windows are opened. This project proposed an idea to mitigate this issue: several force sensors are attached to the bottom of the mouse to provide an additional degree of freedom. Some user interfaces are also brought to '3D' space to utilize the much expanded space. The aim is to increase the interaction efficiency and provide more space for storing user interfaces, while keep everything easy to use and reduce the cost of learning for users. By doing so, user could still interact in a familiar way with similar user interfaces, with just a minor change.
